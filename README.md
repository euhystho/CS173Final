# CS173Final
Genshin Impact inspired Turn Based RPG in Java Swing (Actual Images are not included because of copyright)
~Compiled in NetBeans

If you would like to add your own images and change some names around, you can change entityImages to your respective character in a folder, then their "Name.png" with their abilities being "NameATK.png", "NameSkill.png", and "NameUltimate.png".

PLEASE NOTE: Abilities (ATK, Skill, Ultimate) MUST be in 45x45 pixels big, also for the entities they have to be about 320x320 pixels big to ensure proper photo quality. Also, make sure that the images are transparent for the best viewing experience.

Encounters from the Archeons also known as "Deities" can also be changed using the same naming conventions as the mentioned previously for entities with the same formatting restrictions.
